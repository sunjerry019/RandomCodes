Web App built for the 24 Hour Kayaking Challenge in 2016. The aim was to project some form of display on a screen so that the participants and audience of the challenge could keep track of their efforts on how much money has been raised.

Latest code is not with me but available on the [club server](https://infocommsociety.com/~yicheng/24hrkayak/) and the [full repository](/yicheng340/StaticKayakingTimerDisplay "yicheng340/StaticKayakingTimerDisplay")

Repository was hosted as an afterthought and hence did not accurately depict the contribution history.
