Random codes I've written/adapted that don't quite deserve its own full repository. Also includes any test scripts/proof of concept codes.

## [24hrKayak](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/24hrKayak)

[Full repository](//github.com/yicheng340/StaticKayakingTimerDisplay) and [actual deployment](//infocommsociety.com/~yicheng/24hrkayak/)

Repository was hosted as an afterthought and hence did not accurately depict the contribution history.

Web App built for the 24 Hour Kayaking Challenge in 2016 for our school. The aim was to project some form of display on a screen so that the participants and audience of the challenge could keep track of their efforts on how much money has been raised.

## [BeanMaths](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/BeanMaths)

Scripts to generate maths practice questions for my sister, who was in primary school, based on certain parameters (such as addition and subtraction less than 100). <br>
Output was generated as a latex file, and then compiled with `pdflatex`.
