Random codes I've written/adapted that don't quite deserve its own full repository. Also includes any test scripts/proof of concept codes.

## [ 24hrKayak ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/24hrKayak)

[![Uses HTML/CSS/JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-HTML&sol;CSS&sol;JS-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](//shields.io/)

[Full repository](//github.com/yicheng340/StaticKayakingTimerDisplay "yicheng340/StaticKayakingTimerDisplay") and [actual deployment](//infocommsociety.com/~yicheng/24hrkayak/)

Repository was hosted as an afterthought and hence did not accurately depict the contribution history.

This is a Web App built for the 24 Hour Kayaking Challenge in 2016 for our school. The aim was to project some form of display on a screen so that the participants and audience of the challenge could keep track of their efforts on how much money has been raised.

## [ BeanMaths ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/BeanMaths)

[![Uses Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-Python-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)](//shields.io/)

Scripts to generate maths practice questions for my sister, who was in primary school, based on certain parameters (such as addition and subtraction less than 100). <br>
Output was generated as a latex file, and then compiled with `pdflatex`. Answers are also generated for easy checking.

## [ Brilliant.org ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/Brilliant.org)

[![Uses JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-JavaScript-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=JavaScript)](//shields.io/)

A collection of codes used to solve the problems from [Brilliant.org](//brilliant.org).

Back in the days (2013) when they just had free problems where you could do questions, work your way though like problem sets, and gain points. Once you had enough points, you could exchange for a shirt. I never got to that point though, unfortunately....still kinda wished I had that free brilliant.org shirt.

## [ C_C++_Projects ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/C_C++_Projects)

[![Uses C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-C++-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=C%2B%2B)](//shields.io/)
[![Uses C](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-C-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](//shields.io/)

Mostly a collection of C++ code that I've written in my days of competitive programming. But also just a place to dump all my random C and C++ codes.

Includes random practice and proof of concept codes.

<a name="id_csp"></a>
## [ C# Projects ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/C#%20Projects)

[![Uses C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-C%23-68217A.svg?style=for-the-badge)](//shields.io/)

My brief stint with C# for Windows GUI Applications

<a name="id_cp"></a>
## [ Competitive Programming ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/Competitive%20Programming)

File dump for Competitive Programming related files.

<a name="id_cctf"></a>
## [ CrossCTF2018 ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/CrossCTF2018)

[![Uses Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-Python-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)](//shields.io/)

Files and codes used for [CrossCTF2018](//crossctf.github.io/). We didn't get very far....

<a name="id_dme"></a>
## [ Drang_Math_Editor ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/Drang_Math_Editor)

[![Uses HTML/CSS/JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-HTML&sol;CSS&sol;JS-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](//shields.io/)

A dead project that was supposed to be a math input editor for an e-Learning Portal Project. The name was Drang because the Math teacher that we developed the Portal for was called Dr Ang.

Features were supposed to include things like input using LaTeX macros.

Needless to say it failed miserably.

## [ filediff ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/filediff)

I believe this is just supposed to be some alias to show some diff between 2 files. Can't recall what it was for.

## [ Fortran ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/Fortran)

[![Uses Fortran](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-Fortran-yellowgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](//shields.io/)

Brief stint into Fortran...which I still don't really understand.
