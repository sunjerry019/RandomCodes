## [ 24hrKayak ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/24hrKayak)

[Full repository](//github.com/yicheng340/StaticKayakingTimerDisplay "yicheng340/StaticKayakingTimerDisplay") and [actual deployment](//infocommsociety.com/~yicheng/24hrkayak/)

Repository was hosted as an afterthought and hence did not accurately depict the contribution history.

Web App built for the 24 Hour Kayaking Challenge in 2016 for our school. The aim was to project some form of display on a screen so that the participants and audience of the challenge could keep track of their efforts on how much money has been raised.

## [ BeanMaths ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/BeanMaths)

Scripts to generate maths practice questions for my sister, who was in primary school, based on certain parameters (such as addition and subtraction less than 100). <br>
Output was generated as a latex file, and then compiled with `pdflatex`. Answers are also generated for easy checking.

## [ Brilliant.org ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/Brilliant.org)
A collection of codes used to solve the problems from [Brilliant.org](//brilliant.org).

Back in the days (2013) when they just had free problems where you could do questions, work your way though like problem sets, and gain points. Once you had enough points, you could exchange for a shirt. I never got to that point though, unfortunately....still kinda wished I had that free brilliant.org shirt.

## [ C_C++_Projects ](//github.com/sunjerry019/RandomCodes/tree/master/C_C++_Projects)

A collection of C and C++ code that I've written in my days of competitive programming.
