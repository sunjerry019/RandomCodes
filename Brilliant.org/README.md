A collection of codes used to solve the problems from [Brilliant.org](//brilliant.org).

Back in the days (2013) when they just had free problems where you could do questions, work your way though like problem sets, and gain points. Once you had enough points, you could exchange for a shirt. I never got to that point though, unfortunately....still kinda wished I had that free brilliant.org shirt.

These scripts are made when the only programming language I knew were C++ and JavaScript. JavaScript was much easier for quick writing and deployment, and hence for most of these, JS chosen for the job.
